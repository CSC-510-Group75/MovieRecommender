### &nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements in Project 2

We improved and modernized the functionality and user experience of the movie recommendation system. The goal was to improve both the system's appeal and overall user experience. Important improvements included:
We provided a modern user interface with a simple layout, making it simpler for users to interact with and traverse. We made it netflix-themed to increase its appeal and familiarity.

The OMDb API's integration forms a major part of our upgrade. This gave us access to crucial movie information, including genre, IMDb ratings, and movie posters. Our users now have access to more information about the movie that is being recommended to them.

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) problem was one of the technical issues we ran into and overcame. We have fixed this problem and included the "access-control-allow-origin" header. These combined improvements have produced a movie selection system that is not only good-looking but also more informative.

| Number of commits. |  |  |  |
| Number of commits: by different people. |  |  |  |
| Issues reports: there are many. |  |  |  |
| Issues are being closed. |  |  |  |
| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly. |  |  |  |
| Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation). |  |  |  |
| Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z. |  |  |  |
| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing. |  |  |  |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. |  |  |  |
| Use of version control tools. |  |  |  |
| Test cases exist. |  |  |  |
| Test cases are routinely executed. |  |  |  |
| Issues are discussed before they are closed |  |  |  |
| Chat channel: exists. |  |  |  |
| Test cases:a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. |  |  |  |
